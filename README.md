My first mini-project built with Vanilla JavaScript.

What I've learned:

1. How to access and manipulate the DOM with Vanilla JavaScript.
2. How to apply mouse events.
3. How to change CSS Styles with classes.
4. How to upload a project to GitHub using git from the command line.
5. How to create a pull request in GitHub and merge files.
